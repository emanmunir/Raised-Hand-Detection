# Raise Hand Detector

This is a simple application that uses the webcam to detect if you raise your hand, built with OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Streamlit. It displays a message whenever hand is raised.

## Features

- Detects if your hand is raised in front of the webcam.
- Uses MediaPipe for hand landmark detection.
- Streamlit for a simple web interface.
- Real-time video streaming with Streamlit WebRTC.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Streamlit
- Streamlit WebRTC
- NumPy

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/raise-hand-detector.git
    cd raise-hand-detector
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To run the hand raise detector, execute:

```sh
streamlit run main.py
```

This will start a Streamlit server, and you can access the application in your web browser.

## File Structure

- `main.py`: The main script that runs the hand raise detector.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all dependencies required to run the project.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## How It Works

- The script uses MediaPipe to track hand landmarks.
- It checks if all fingers are straight up (by comparing the Y-coordinates of each fingertip with the preceding joint).
- If all fingers are raised, it displays a message "I raised my hand!" on the video feed.
